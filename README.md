Client: Console

Server: Console

Shared-Library: Library

Pupper-Master: Graphic Application

PCS: Console

## Running

Build PCS and PuppetMaster in Visual Studio

Put script files you want to run along with the PCS.exe

Run the PCS.exe 

Run the PuppetMaster.exe

The PuppetMaster takes commands from a file or a command line

The Shutdown button only works if you don't shutdown any of the servers or clients manually, otherwise it will block the puppet master

Alternatively you can just build the PuppetMaster and run it directly from Visual Studio as it will automaticaly build all the projects and run the Puppet-Master and PCS

Have fun
